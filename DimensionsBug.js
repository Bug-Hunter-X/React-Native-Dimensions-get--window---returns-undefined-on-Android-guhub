This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions on Android.  The `Dimensions.get('window').width` and `Dimensions.get('window').height` sometimes return `undefined` during the initial render, or even after a few renders, leading to layout issues or crashes. This is especially prevalent when combined with animations or dynamic content updates.
